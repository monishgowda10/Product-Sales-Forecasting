## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting product sales using historical data, leveraging time series analysis and machine learning techniques. Developed in Google Colab, it uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, and Keras to preprocess data, perform analyses, and build predictive models like Moving Average and LSTM.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare retail store data for analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Perform exploratory analysis and visualizations to understand sales trends over time.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implement and compare different forecasting models including Moving Average and LSTM.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations of sales trends and forecast results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account to access and run the project in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Basic understanding of Python programming and time series analysis concepts.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishgowda10/product-sales-forecasting.git
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vvxWoIfWhs16Rj1zgBkXNZr-x58p-3kT?usp=sharing).
   - Upload the `Product_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb` notebook.
   - Alternatively, open it directly from GitHub in Colab with the "Open in Colab" button if linked.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and forecasts.
   - Modify any parameters as needed for further exploration.
